# LCCN-Clothing1M

This is the code of the Clothing-1M experiments for our paper "Safeguarded Dynamic Label Regression for Generalized Noisy Supervision". We have provided multiple scripts to run the baselines and our model. Note that, the parameters have been hard-coded in the script. 

In addition, it is almost the same code of the WebVision experiments. You can simply organize the data structure of WebVision like Clothing1M and run the codes.
